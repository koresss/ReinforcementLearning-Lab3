 - Implementation of _Experience Replay(ER), Combined Experience Replay(CER), Priritized Experience Replay(PER) and Hindsight Experience Replay_
 -  All the ER are tested on the following environments from the [gym library](https://gym.openai.com/ "Gym Homepage"): _CartPole-v1_ and _CubeCrashSparse-v0_. And another envirionment from this [git repo](https://github.com/viraat/hindsight-experience-replay) that was addapted to all the other ER methods.
